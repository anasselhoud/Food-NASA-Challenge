# Food_for_Thought-Challenge
This repository contains some useful algorithms we mentioned in our solutions for the Covid-19 NASA Challenge.


- Path Optimizer: This code can be used to generate the optimal path between two points A and B in an maze. It is based on the A* algorithm. It can be used only for a one agent problem. Once run, a Tkinter graphical user interface is opened, you put the (x,y) coordinates of the start point which refers to the initial position of the vehicle, and then the (x,y) coordinates of the final destination. The lunch button generate automatically the path and saves it, and finally shows it on a colored graph.

- Demand Forecasting: this model aims to forecast the food demand of next 3months based on the last years demand.  
This will help the warehouses workers have an idea of the decisions to take based on AI models. The connected warehouses
is an innovative idea proposed in our solution for the NASA Challenge.

- Agri-Identifier: This model is included with the drone solution. It can identify the best place to plan a specific fruit or vegetable based on weather and soil data.
